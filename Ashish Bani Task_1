#TASK 1 
:- Creating Employee DB
1. create employee(emp_id,employee_name,department_id,location_id,salary), 
   department(dept_id,department_name),
   locations (location_id, location_name) tables with relevant attributes.
2. create primary key on each table and foreign keys (location->department, department->employee)
ex: emp_id is PK in emp table, dept_id is PK in dept table, loc_id is PK in location table.
3. insert 20 employees data, 4 departments data, 2 locations data.

a) select maximum salary earned from each department
b) select 2nd highest salary from each department.
c) select location_name, department_name, average_salary(of each location)

additional queries:
>> Show departments with no of employees
>> Show locations with no of department where no of department is 2
